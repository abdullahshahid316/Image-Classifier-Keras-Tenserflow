# Image-Classifier-Keras-Tenserflow

This project focuses on the creation and use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the purpose of image classification. It aims to illustrate how CNNs can be effectively employed to recognize and categorize objects in images, specifically utilizing the Oxford-III Pet Dataset.

Key aspects of the project include:

Developing a Convolutional Neural Network using tools like TensorFlow and Keras-tuner, initially leveraging mobilenetV2 architecture, and subsequently constructing a custom neural network.

Applying data preprocessing methods suitable for image data to enhance the effectiveness of the model.

Employing various strategies to assess and validate the performance of the model.
